[![Build Status](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-2-visualizer/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-2-visualizer/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repository contains the source code behind [jmerle.github.io/imc-prosperity-2-visualizer/](https://jmerle.github.io/imc-prosperity-2-visualizer/), a visualizer for [IMC Prosperity 2](https://prosperity.imc.com/) algorithms. It is based on my [IMC Prosperity 1 visualizer](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-visualizer).


Forked from jmerle. Added new graphs for custom data we are calculating.
